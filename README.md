A Link Cleaner CLI tool to clean up your links.
This gets rid of the various tracking parameters and other parameters that are added to the links.

_Currently, Links which redirect one to other webpages, are not supported.. Looking into that soon._

_There is a plan to publish this to npm as well._

## Planned Usage -

```bash
linkcl [options] (url)
```
