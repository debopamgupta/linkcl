## Link Cleaner CLI

> Debopam Gupta 2022

A Link Cleaner CLI tool to clean up your links.
This gets rid of the various tracking parameters and other parameters that are added to the links.

Web Links which redirect to other websites are also removed and should work for the most part.

_There is a plan to publish this to npm as well._

## Planned Usage -

```bash
linkcl [options] (url)
```

#### Example
